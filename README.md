# DentCorex Dental Lab Manager

This repository demonstrates a minimal SwiftUI project for the DentCorex Dental Lab Manager application. It includes basic models and views to get started with an iOS-first implementation.

The `DentCorexApp` directory contains sample Swift code with the following components:

- `DentCorexApp.swift`: Application entry point and simple login routing
- `Models/`: Basic data structures such as `UserRole`, `DentalCase`, and `CaseStep`
- `Views/`: Placeholder views for login, listing cases, and viewing case details

The project does not compile on its own in this environment. To continue development, open the directory in Xcode and create a new iOS project, then copy the files into your project.
